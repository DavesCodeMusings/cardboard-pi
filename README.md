# Cardboard Pi
An inexpensive mounting system for Raspberry Pi and 2.5" SATA drive.

## Why?
It seems counterintuitive to spend a lot of money on case for a device that cost $35.

## How?
You'll need some cardboard the size of a sheet of paper and about 1/8" to 1/4" thick.
Something cut from a shipping box or a flat from canned goods is ideal.

1. Print the template from [the PDF file](CardboardPi2.pdf).
2. Follow the included instructions for assembly.
3. Mount your Pi and SATA drive, route the cables, and bask in your thriftiness.

Paper size is 8.5" x 11", but A4 should be close enough. Scale is approximate.

The [original document](CardboardPi2.odg) was created with LibreOffice Draw.

>Some printers may have trouble printing the shapes close to the edge of the
>page (in the area normally reserved for document margins.) If this happens,
>try rotating the page in your PDF viewer and printing it upside down.
