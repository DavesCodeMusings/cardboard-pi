# Cardboard Pi
An inexpensive mounting system for Raspberry Pi and 2.5" SATA drive.

1. Print the template from [the PDF file](CardboardPi.pdf).
2. Follow the included instructions for assembly.
3. Mount your Pi and SATA drive, route the cables, and bask in your thriftiness.

Paper size is 8.5" x 11", but A4 should be close enough. Scale is approximate.
