# Cardboard Pi
Inexpensive mounting options for Raspberry Pi 4B and a 2.5" SATA drive.

## Why?
It seems counterintuitive to spend a lot of money on case for a device that cost $35.

## How?
You'll need some cardboard about 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Something cut from a shipping box or flat from canned goods is ideal.

### Cardboard Pi 2
_The number two does not indicate Raspberry Pi 2, it is simply the second attempt at a cardboard mounting system._

Of all the mounting systems here, this is probably the most straighforward to build. It does, however, require screws to
secure the Pi and the SATA drive.

To build it:
1. Print the template from [the PDF file](CardboardPi2.pdf).
2. Follow the included instructions for assembly.
3. Mount your Pi and SATA drive, route the cables, and bask in your thriftiness.

Paper size is 8.5" x 11", but A4 should be close enough.

### Cardboard Pi 3
The third iteration involves more stacking and layering and less folding. No screws are required to secure the components.
It's a bit like building a Lego model. No need to print a template, just follow the instructions in [the PDF file](CardboardPi3.pdf).

The difficulty in building this mounting system is the number of pieces that need to be cut at precise widths. Not the easiest thing
to do with cardboard and a box cutter. However, the design cound be adapted to use wood or acrylic materials that can be machine cut.

### Cardboard Pi 1
The first attempt at a mounting system involves too much cutting and has a cable management system that is too cramped.
Still, if you want to try it, it's [here](CardboardPi.pdf).
